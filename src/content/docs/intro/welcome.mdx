Building your own CNC machine is pretty awesome, expanding your own knowledge and manufacturing capabilities at the same time.  
But the  world of DIY CNC machining can be pretty overwhealming, especially if you are just getting started. 
This wiki should be a guide for everyone looking to build their own CNC machine. 
It provides references and links to all kind of projects from all over the internet and can be used as a reference itself.

## Structure

A quick overview of the different chapters

## Scope

This wiki covers all aspects from hardware to software and building the machine. It also gives some basic understanding of machining but this is just an overview and is completet by some links to external resources for further learning.

This wiki is mainly meant for cnc mills and routers. There is also some specific knowledge for lathes, lasercutters and fiberlasers but those are mostly out of scope.

3D printers can also be considered CNC machines and some parts of this site might apply to them but they are not at all considered in the writing of this.
