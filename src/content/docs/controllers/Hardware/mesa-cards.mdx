Mesa cards are motion-control and I/O interface boards commonly used with LinuxCNC.
They sit between the control PC and machine hardware like drives, encoders, limits, relays, and panel inputs.

The short version: if you want flexible, real-time capable machine control with industrial-style wiring options, Mesa is one of the strongest ecosystems in the LinuxCNC world.

## What Mesa cards are used for

A LinuxCNC PC is excellent at planning motion, running UI logic, and coordinating machine behavior.
Mesa hardware handles the time-critical electrical side:

- generating deterministic step/dir pulses
- reading fast encoder feedback
- switching and sampling machine I/O
- isolating the PC from direct field wiring

Most Mesa designs are FPGA-based. That FPGA logic is a key reason they perform reliably at high pulse rates and low jitter, even on modest PCs.

## Main card vs daughter cards

In most setups you start with one **main card** that connects to the PC and hosts the real-time FPGA interface.
You then add **daughter cards** when you need more I/O or specialized functions.

A practical way to size a system:

1. Count axis outputs and drive signal type (step/dir, +/-10V analog, or serial drive protocol).
2. Count feedback channels (encoders, spindle encoder, handwheel/MPG).
3. Count field I/O (limits, probes, estop chain, coolant, lube, lights, tool changer signals).
4. Add 20-30% headroom for future additions.

## PC connection options

Mesa cards are typically connected to LinuxCNC in one of these ways:

### Ethernet

Most common for new builds.
Easy physical wiring and good performance for the majority of machines.
In practice, many builders dedicate one NIC port to the Mesa link.

### PCI / PCIe

Still valid and often very fast, but less convenient on modern small-form-factor PCs.
Good option when you have compatible hardware and want an internal card install.

### SPI

Relevant for Raspberry Pi style setups.
Useful for compact systems, but you should still treat real-time tuning and EMI protection seriously.

## Expansion interfaces between cards

When one board is not enough, Mesa offers multiple expansion paths:

- `50-pin`: high-density ribbon style expansion with broad signal access
- `DB25` / `26-pin compatible`: simpler connector format with fewer lines
- `SmartSerial (SSerial)`: Mesa serial field bus (often over RJ45 cabling, but not Ethernet networking)

SmartSerial is ideal for distributed panel and general I/O modules.
For very high-speed motion signals and encoder-heavy workloads, direct FPGA I/O connectors are usually preferred.

## Typical example configuration (3-axis mill)

Example requirements:

- 3 axes on step/dir drives
- spindle speed command (0-10V)
- linear scale or encoder feedback
- coolant/lube/light/tool-clamp relays
- operator panel with buttons and handwheel

One common approach is:

1. Main card: `7i96S` (Ethernet, step/dir-friendly, integrated field I/O, analog spindle output)
2. Feedback expansion: `7i85S` (encoder-focused daughter card via DB25-style expansion)
3. Panel/distributed I/O: `7i73` over SmartSerial

This split keeps motion-critical signals on the fast core interface while moving operator I/O to a simple serial field link.

## Common selection mistakes to avoid

- Undersizing digital outputs for future accessories
- Forgetting isolated input requirements for noisy industrial cabinets
- Treating SmartSerial cabling as normal Ethernet switching traffic
- Choosing only by card price and ignoring cabinet wiring effort

If you are unsure, first choose by electrical interface and I/O map, then optimize price.
